# Weekend-challange-2-FetchAPI-
In this tutorial,I learned about the JavaScript Fetch API and how to use it to make asynchronous HTTP requests.

The Fetch API allows you to asynchronously request for a resource.

Use the fetch() method to return a promise that resolves into a Response object. To get the actual data, you call one of the methods of the Response object e.g., text() or json(). These methods resolve into the actual data.

Use the status and statusText properties of the Response object to get the status and status text of the response.

use the catch() method or try...catch statement to handle a failure request.
